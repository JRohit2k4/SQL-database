## Keys 🗝

**Primary key :**  
- It is a column (or set of column) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id)  
- There is only 1 primary key in a table & it should be NOT null.  
- e.g : 
```
id int PRIMARY KEY
```  

**Foreign key :**  
- A foreign key is a column (or set of column) in a table that refers to a primary key in another table.  
- There can be multiple foreign keys.  
- Foreign keys can have duplicate & null values.
- e.g : 
```
CREATE TABLE course(
id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (id) reference student(id)
);
```
